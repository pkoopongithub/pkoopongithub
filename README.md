- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pkoopongithub

- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in psychometrics and the open source development of psychometric tests and much more ...
Since 2012, the DÃ¼sseldorf student inventory, open source, has served as a learning environment for students of social sciences and trainees in market and social research, application development and data and process analysis.
The DÃ¼sseldorf student inventory is an open source, valid, precise and independent personality inventory for students in the transition classes (valid, reliable, objective). The DÃ¼sseldorf student inventory is open to development.
I am happy to provide the raw data, SPSS files, R files and source codes of the programs (Internet, PC, Android- , iOS smartphone available (PHP, MySQL, Xcode, Android Studio, Xamarin, Lazarus).

When you work on an open source project, you know the intense, personal commitment that contributes to its success. Many users know and appreciate this. However, not everything succeeds with the developers' own strength, especially since in many cases only pure interest in the topic or the use of technologies provide the basis. However, not every user has the skills and the time to support a project. Verbal feedback in the form of error messages is very helpful.

For others, material support may be the only way to get involved in open source.

I would be happy to talk to you about your type of support:

- record further raw data,
- continuously update calibration samples, test statistics, multivariate analyzes, etc.
- improve GUI design,
- Offer a persistent database in compliance with data protection regulations: DB Api and HTTPS Access,
- Include other development environments (Eclipse, Intellij IDE, Lazarus, NetBeans, Scene Builder, Android Studio, Xcode, Visual Studio) on an ongoing basis,
- User training, tutorials, YouTube tutorials,
- technical editing, professional editing.

I would like to submit a funding application for "Software Sprint - Funding for Open Source Developers" for the "Teaching and Learning Platform DÃ¼sseldorf Student Inventory".

 My focus is on algorithms and data structures and statistics and data analysis. Since 2012, the DÃ¼sseldorf Student Inventory, which I developed, has been used as an open-source, valid, reliable, and objective learning platform for learning classical test theory. Due to the Covid-19 crisis, I started digitizing the learning environment in November 2021 (PHP, MySQL, Android Studio, Xcode, Xamarin, Lazarus, R, PSPP) and publishing it on github.

I would now like to take the next step and expand the learning platform into a virtual psychometric counseling environment for students and trainees for practical learning of the development and programming of psychometric tests (programming of psychometric tests). All source codes are to be made open source and published on github as before.

I would like to involve other individuals from IT, multimedia, HR consulting, psychology and have talked to individuals informally about the costs.

As I am retired, I would like to have the younger individuals represent me when handling the project.

I assume that the individual calculations for the project steps amount to â‚¬5000-8000 per project step and are between â‚¬50000 and â‚¬80000 in total.

For the following subtasks, I will nominate project partners with partial calculations for the project application:

-Project marketing and project publishing (freelance individual) 5000â‚¬,

-Database connection Android Studio, Xcode, Xamarin (freelance programmer) 5000â‚¬,

-Layout Android Studio (freelance designer/ programmer) 5000â‚¬,

-Layout Android Studio, Xcode, Xamarin (freelance designer/ programmer) 5000â‚¬,

-Layout Bootstrap (freelance designer/programmer) 5000â‚¬

-Instructional films Youtube channel test application test evaluation (freelance individual) 5000â‚¬,

-Moodle teaching platform test application test evaluation (freelance individual) 5000â‚¬,

-several evaluators and/or rod data collectors (freelance psychologists, careers advisers, coaches, etc.) â‚¬5,000.

I would like to submit a project proposal for the whole team of individuals. Before that, I would like to ask the individuals I would like to submit to the project application for calculations. I am happy to receive feedback with individual calculations for the subtasks that you want to take on. But you also support me a lot if you follow me on github.
