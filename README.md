- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pkoopongithub

- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in psychometrics and the open source development of psychometric tests and much more ...
Since 2012, the DÃ¼sseldorf student inventory, open source, has served as a learning environment for students of social sciences and trainees in market and social research, application development and data and process analysis.
The DÃ¼sseldorf student inventory is an open source, valid, precise and independent personality inventory for students in the transition classes (valid, reliable, objective). The DÃ¼sseldorf student inventory is open to development.
I am happy to provide the raw data, SPSS files, R files and source codes of the programs (Internet, PC, Android- , iOS smartphone available (PHP, MySQL, Xcode, Android Studio, Xamarin, Lazarus).

When you work on an open source project, you know the intense, personal commitment that contributes to its success. Many users know and appreciate this. However, not everything succeeds with the developers' own strength, especially since in many cases only pure interest in the topic or the use of technologies provide the basis. However, not every user has the skills and the time to support a project. Verbal feedback in the form of error messages is very helpful.

For others, material support may be the only way to get involved in open source.

I would be happy to talk to you about your type of support:

- record further raw data,
- continuously update calibration samples, test statistics, multivariate analyzes, etc.
- improve GUI design,
- Offer a persistent database in compliance with data protection regulations: DB Api and HTTPS Access,
- Include other development environments (Eclipse, Intellij IDE, Lazarus, NetBeans, Scene Builder, Android Studio, Xcode, Visual Studio) on an ongoing basis,
- User training, tutorials, YouTube tutorials,
- technical editing, professional editing.

I would like to submit a funding application for "Software Sprint - Funding for Open Source Developers" for the "Teaching and Learning Platform DÃ¼sseldorf Student Inventory".

 My focus is on algorithms and data structures and statistics and data analysis. Since 2012, the DÃ¼sseldorf Student Inventory, which I developed, has been used as an open-source, valid, reliable, and objective learning platform for learning classical test theory. Due to the Covid-19 crisis, I started digitizing the learning environment in November 2021 (PHP, MySQL, Android Studio, Xcode, Xamarin, Lazarus, R, PSPP) and publishing it on github.
